# mission

Chord symbols, especially with tensions, are just being explicit about the voicing, and better with the note (G-7). They're descriptive. But analysis / mode notation is generative. By looking at a lead sheet, for example, and converting chords to mode-analysis, that's just opening it up for more improvisational possibilities. So it's a good distinction. 

## future

What is traditional function here? Can abandon that if we don't privilege 3rds and 7ths and allow extensions to be functional. Maybe that's a program setting.


## todo

- should bold transistions when there's multiple to one chord -- strong tendency
- should take colors out of the leads function and put in display


- what do the colors mean again?


### modal interchange

got the chord spelling wrong!

have to choose pitches based on the chord, not the key, if it's not diatonic



### secondary dominants

they are either going to their dominants, or they might be deceptive and going to another secondary dominant. that's in here.

they could also be going to some other related II chord that then goes to another secondary dominant. if all those chords are in the system, it's implicit, but that takes some prior intention.

also, tensions on secondary dominants can be true to the chord OR diatonic to the home key, depending on how much tonicization you want to do. no real way to account for that here.


### other scale forms

this depends on 7 note scales, and it's still very tertiary

pentatonic scales, modes of different length, etc. how does that work with leading tones?
