A chord-scale-mode (better name? let's just say scale?) is a set of notes building on a root with a certain quality that is functional relative to a key, and that is what is indicated in analysis symbols. Scales are generative. A chord per se, especially with tensions, is just being explicit about which notes of a scale are voiced (leaving _how_ they are voiced to the staff). Chords are descriptive. By looking at a lead sheet, converting chords back to scales, that's just opening it up for more improvisational possibilities. So it's a good distinction. 

Given a scale, there are multiple different chords that can be voiced. 1, 3, 5, 7 degrees are commonly functional, (and imply certain avoid notes if you're improvising with the scale over them), but 2, 4, and 6 can be functional too, and those degrees (under 8) imply that 3 and/or 7 might not be played. If they are understood as 9, 11, or 13, they are valid color/tensions added on top of some kind of 7th.

Turns out with all the various chord types, all the possibilities of the scale are covered, even if the naming scheme is awkward for historical reasons. 

For my top-down process, it's 1) pick the scales for quality and function, 2) pick the chord, 3) voice the notes. How the notes are voiced also depends on the horizontal relationship, transitions, voicing-leading etc.

Voice-leading is stepwise motion, avoiding parallel motion, all the counterpoint stuff. Transitions, it turns out, are of 4 types: circle of 5/4ths, dominant to sub-dominant and vice versa, step-wise resolution of chord tones, and "morphs" where there is a shared root or 3rd.


## todo

- should bold transistions when there's multiple to one chord -- strong tendency
- should take colors out of the leads function and put in display [what?]

- what do the colors mean again?

- think about how 2, 4 sus and 6ths can be represented; separate chords listed in parallel to indicate the same functional role. the mode name and functional role applies to the whole row.

- listing a 7th chord in the leads doesn't make sense, unless it is indeed pointing to a specific voicing. right now I am basically just showing the 7th chord.



### modal interchange

got the chord spelling wrong!

have to choose pitches based on the chord, not the key, if it's not diatonic



### secondary dominants

they are either going to their dominants, or they might be deceptive and going to another secondary dominant. that's in here.

they could also be going to some other related II chord that then goes to another secondary dominant. if all those chords are in the system, it's implicit, but that takes some prior intention.

also, tensions on secondary dominants can be true to the chord OR diatonic to the home key, depending on how much tonicization you want to do. no real way to account for that here.


### other scale forms

this depends on 7 note scales, and it's still very tertiary

pentatonic scales, modes of different length, etc. how does that work with leading tones?
