- should bold transistions when there's multiple to one chord -- strong tendency
- should take colors out of the leads function and put in display

### minor

exclude transitions to same scale degree


### secondary dominants

they are either going to their dominants, or they might be deceptive and going to another secondary dominant. that's in here.

they could also be going to some other related II chord that then goes to another secondary dominant. if all those chords are in the system, it's implicit, but that takes some prior intention.

also, tensions on secondary dominants can be true to the chord OR diatonic to the home key, depending on how much tonicization you want to do. no real way to account for that here.


### other scale forms

this depends on 7 note scales, and it's still very tertiary

pentatonic scales, modes of different length, etc. how does that work with leading tones?



### mission

how is this used? it helps to come up with progressions and voicings and even melodies by indicating avoid notes and functional transitions associated with each note in a chord
