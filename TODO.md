how is this used? it helps to come up with progressions and voicings and even melodies by indicating avoid notes and functional transitions associated with each note in a chord


/// minor


leads are major key specific. should work off of any mode. need to auto-detect half-steps.

identifying out-of-key notes is also major specific.

chord list itself is major-key specific.


/// secondary dominants

they are either going to their dominants, or they might be deceptive and going to another secondary dominant. that's in here.

but they could also be going to a related II chord. do we get that? only if I add these chords in there. 

...but that would generate relationships that skip the dominant. so how do we deal with that? a concept of chord class, but that's not very fundamental.



/// other scale forms

it's still very tertiary

pentatonic scales, modes of different length, etc. How does that work with leading tones?
