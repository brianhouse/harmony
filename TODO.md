- should bold transistions when there's multiple to one chord -- strong tendency
- should take colors out of the leads function and put in display

### minor

got the chord spelling wrong!
have to choose pitches based on the chord


exclude transitions to same scale degree

maybe it would make sense to have labels as the scale + the modal rotation. that's really what's going on. obvi major scale rotations are the most common. but looks like Jazz scale is big too, Dorian rotations, etc etc. If it's a mode, it's good to know that, but it's also about the mode relative to the scale.

DOR-III or whatever does do that. hmm, no. III is the role relative to AOL-I, not necessarily the rotation of Dorian. Which isn't a thing, though, DOR2 is just MYX. So it's the named mode, and then the role. There's a lot of sense to that, versus chord symbols (III-7). Or rather, chord symbols, especially with tensions, are just being explicit about the voicing, and better with the note (G-7). They're descriptive. But the mode notation is generative, that's really analysis. By looking at a lead sheet, for example, and converting chords to mode-analysis, that's just opening it up for more improvisational possibilities. So it's a good distinction. 

For the program purposes, I want the analysis, but the root is also helpful to know. So it's like III:MYX:G

Of course, the other issue is that modes of other scales don't have names. 

And again we have the issue of secondary dominants, how to explain function. Maybe indeed function is another field. III:MYX:G [V7/VI]. Same with interchange. Just an explanation to know where it's coming from. More an issue with secondary dominants, as I choose interchange in advance.


### secondary dominants

they are either going to their dominants, or they might be deceptive and going to another secondary dominant. that's in here.

they could also be going to some other related II chord that then goes to another secondary dominant. if all those chords are in the system, it's implicit, but that takes some prior intention.

also, tensions on secondary dominants can be true to the chord OR diatonic to the home key, depending on how much tonicization you want to do. no real way to account for that here.


### other scale forms

this depends on 7 note scales, and it's still very tertiary

pentatonic scales, modes of different length, etc. how does that work with leading tones?



### mission

how is this used? it helps to come up with progressions and voicings and even melodies by indicating avoid notes and functional transitions associated with each note in a chord
