- A chord is just a mode until it is given a role
- What is a key? A key is a tonic note AND and 

it's like defining a harmonic world as a set of chords

is a chord independent from it's role? you know, I don't think it is.

it shouldn't be minor / major anyway, it should take any chord as tonic.


### minor


leads are major key specific. should work off of any mode. need to auto-detect half-steps.

identifying out-of-key notes is also major specific.

chord list itself is major-key specific.


### secondary dominants

they are either going to their dominants, or they might be deceptive and going to another secondary dominant. that's in here.

but they could also be going to a related II chord. do we get that? only if I add these chords in there. 

...but that would generate relationships that skip the dominant. so how do we deal with that? a concept of chord class, but that's not very fundamental.



### other scale forms

we depend on 7 notes

and it's still very tertiary

pentatonic scales, modes of different length, etc. how does that work with leading tones?



### mission

how is this used? it helps to come up with progressions and voicings and even melodies by indicating avoid notes and functional transitions associated with each note in a chord
