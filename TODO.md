need major/minor

/

leads are major key specific. should work off of any mode. need to auto-detect half-steps.
identifying out-of-key notes is also major specific.
chord list itself is major-key specific.

how would related II chords factor in? they dont exist in analysis, only in relation to how a secondary dominant is used. well, every secondary dominant could have one attached I guess.

almost have to built the chain backward from the resolved tonic

really begs an interactive format of some kind. show one chord at a time and move forward/backward, substitute, etc

yeah, chains is the thing

do I get secondary dominant deceptive resolutions for free? I might.

how is this used? it helps to come up with voicings or even melodies by indicating avoid notes and functional transitions associated with each note in a chord


/// other scale forms

it's still very tertiary

should tension tones allow transitions? (later)

if so, should they go to other tension tones? that ends up meaning any chord goes to any chord, which flattens things. previously, I was defining "chord tones", which might be arbitrary, or at least root + fifth + ___ . so could have a whole alt system there. not necessary now!

also need to support pentatonic scales, modes of different length, etc. How does that work with leading tones?
