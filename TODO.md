- should bold transistions when there's multiple to one chord -- strong tendency
- should take colors out of the leads function and put in display



### minor

not quite right with sharps and flats. D minor, for example, uses flats.



### secondary dominants

they are either going to their dominants, or they might be deceptive and going to another secondary dominant. that's in here.

but they could also be going to a related II chord. do we get that? only if I add these chords in there. 

...but that would generate relationships that skip the dominant. so how do we deal with that? a concept of chord class, but that's not very fundamental.



### other scale forms

we depend on 7 notes

and it's still very tertiary

pentatonic scales, modes of different length, etc. how does that work with leading tones?



### mission

how is this used? it helps to come up with progressions and voicings and even melodies by indicating avoid notes and functional transitions associated with each note in a chord
